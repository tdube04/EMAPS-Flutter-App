# tes_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I have decided to let the App run from the dashboard as shown to avoid some complications with other modules. This way you will just need to integrate the map after the user clicks e.g the police>Nearby Location> Then the Map with the route which is not yet there.
